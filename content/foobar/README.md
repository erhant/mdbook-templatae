## Math

You can do some fancy $\LaTeX$ math:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \ldots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

## Mermaid

You can draw Mermaid diagrams:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A --> B;
  B --> C
```

My favorite is a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor A as Alice
  actor B as Bob

  note over A: hi
  A ->> B: whats up?
  note over B: bye
```
